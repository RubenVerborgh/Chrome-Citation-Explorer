## Makes it easier to export citations
As a researcher, you probably spend quite some time looking for correct citations to use in your paper.

Unfortunately, some publishers make it notoriously difficult to quickly export citations.
This extension fixes that.

In this first version, we offer a solution for SpringerLink.
Now you can just copy/paste the citation from your browser,
instead of the website saving a file to your disk, you having to open the file, copy its contents, paste them in your article, and removing the file again.
Just copy/pasting is a lot easier ;-)
